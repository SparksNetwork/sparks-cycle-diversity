# Sparks.Network Cycle Diversity Frontend

## Overview

The Sparks.Network is a new platform that engages volunteers with the people who need them.

We're not just a volunteer management app, and we're not just a craigslist for volunteers.  We're solving volunteering in the same way that Uber, Airbnb, and other sharing economy apps: by connecting those that have, with those that need, and giving them the tools to work together.

### Ethos

Volunterism is a fundamental part of our company ethos, and open source is just another expression of that.  As we continue to develop this application, we are constantly looking for ways to extract things into more reusable libraries that we can give back to the community.  If you see anything like that in the code, open an issue and let us know!

### Contributions

Development is driven by in-house developers at the Sparks.Network.  Public participation (up to and including pull requests) are welcome.  We are investigating ways to reward outside contributions to the code with both cash and equity.  Please email [Steve DeBaun](mailto://sdebaun@sparks.network) with suggestions!

Please use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit` so we can have uniform commit message styles!

### Team

Yes, we are hiring!  The Sparks.Network is a startup with seed funding that is making the world a better place.  We are currently hiring part- or full-time developers.  [Want to know more?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hnV0jEbEeFGPfOgU_zQmjahdM44RAAFPzPX7fDlkE4
